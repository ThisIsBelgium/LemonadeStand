SOLID principles:
I display the single responsibility principle in my project in my Ice,Sugar,Lemon,and Cups classes.
This is displayed by the fact that I only use methods that do one thing and one thing well throughout the classes

I display the interface segregation principle in my program class by only forcing it
to instantiate and run the game.Run() function
